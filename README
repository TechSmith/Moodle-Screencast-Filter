Moodle-Screencast-Filter

Description:
This is a text filter for Moodle that converts Screencast.com urls into embeded content.  The current text filter will only replace hyperlinks with the embeded content.  This only works for video short urls.

Installation:
Download the .zip file and unzip the "screencast" folder to the moodle/filter folder on the Moodle server.
